5. Play proceeds from the left end of the line to the right

## Objective

Win the most points by winning battles.

## Each Battle
1. Both players select a card to play and place it facedown either side of the neutral
2. Once both players have played, flip both played cards face up
3. Resolve the battle according the following rules and award points

## Resolving a Battle

1. If both players play cards of the same rank, it's a tie
2. If neither played card beats the neutral, it's also a tie
3. Otherwise, the player whose played card beats the other player wins
4. The winner gets 1 point for the current battle and every tied battle since the last decisive battle

## Card Power

- Cards of higher rank beat cards of lower rank
- Aces are the only exception: they beat any face card but are beaten by any number card
